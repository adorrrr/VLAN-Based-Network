VLAN-Based Network Design with RIP v2
This project was completed as part of the Data Communication final course project.

Overview
A multi-router enterprise-style network was designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes VLAN segmentation, multiple LANs, and WAN links with dynamic routing using RIP version 2.

Key Features
Multi-router topology with LAN and WAN connectivity
RIP v2 routing protocol with no auto-summary
Multiple subnet advertisements
End-to-end connectivity verification
VLAN-based segmentation
Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer
RIP v2
IPv4 Subnetting
VLAN Configuration
Router and Switch Configuration
