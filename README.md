# VLAN-Based Network Design with RIP v2

## 📘 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Data Communication final course project**. It demonstrates the design and implementation of an enterprise-style network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, focusing on **VLAN segmentation**, **multi-router connectivity**, and **dynamic routing with RIP version 2**.

The network is designed to support multiple LANs and WAN links while ensuring efficient routing and end-to-end connectivity across all segments.



## 🧩 Network Features

* Multi-router topology with both **LAN and WAN connectivity**
* **VLAN-based segmentation** to isolate network traffic
* Dynamic routing using **RIP v2**

  * `no auto-summary` enabled
  * Multiple subnet advertisements
* Proper **IPv4 subnet planning**
* End-to-end connectivity verification using testing tools (ping, traceroute)



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Cisco Packet Tracer**
* **RIP Version 2**
* **IPv4 Subnetting**
* **VLAN Configuration**
* Cisco **Router and Switch Configuration**



## 📂 Project Files

* `VLAN RIP Network.pkt`
  *Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file containing the complete network configuration.*

* `VLAN RIP Network.png`
  *Network topology diagram illustrating routers, switches, VLANs, and WAN links.*



## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following skills were developed:

* Understanding and configuring **dynamic routing protocols**
* Designing **enterprise-style network topologies**
* Implementing **VLANs for network segmentation**
* Applying **subnetting concepts** in real-world scenarios
* Troubleshooting and validating **end-to-end network connectivity**



## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download and install **Cisco Packet Tracer**
2. Open the file `VLAN RIP Network.pkt`
3. Review router and switch configurations
4. Use simulation or real-time mode to test connectivity between VLANs and networks
